//This Kernel will be dedicated to forward feeding and backward propigation which gets error and new weights for one training pair.
// The input will be...	void training(T trainData[64][numIn_],int trueOut[64][numOut_],const int numTrainSample,
                      //const float learnRate,const long maxNumTrainIterate,float (*pLogisticFun)(float))

//The output will be the updated weights for each training pair



//This Kernel will be dedicated to updating the weights and biases for one batch
